	<p>To strike out on your own, head to this semihidden beach on the island’s far southern shore. Accessible via a 3km walk down a steep hill (or a brief, bumpy ride in the back of the truck), the petite cove is attractively framed by palm trees and massive boulders. You’ll find a handful of low-key bars and restaurants, and although you won’t be alone, you almost certainly won’t feel like part of the crowd.</p>
